## Instructions

Once you visit the website you will be greeted with our easy to use game manager. Here you can add players, track life totals, Perform coin tosses or roll dice. You will also be able to visit our orcale search view the link at the button right of the page. All cards were provided by the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/). Here you can look up or filter through cards you would like to know about. You can click on card to expan them and get a more detialed look. These are all features avaible without making an account.

If you would like to make and account you can hit the log in button on any page of the site. This will prompt you to either login or create an account. If you fail to login you will be prompted to try again. After a few attempts we provide access to reset your password. When you make your account you will set a username, password, and a secret question. The secret question will be used incase you forget your password. With an account made you can now create decks. Go to your account page through the middle option at the bottom of the screen. Here you can add a deck or edit existing decks. Once you have a deck you can search for cards in a similar fashion to the oracle search. However, this time you can click on cards to set them up to be added. If a card is in the added section you can click it again to add it to your side board or click it two times to remove it from your selection. Now select all the cards you want and then add them to your deck,it's as simpl as that!
